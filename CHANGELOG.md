# Puppetry 1.1.0

### Bug fixes
- fix: adding record row is not expandable

### Features
- improve UI: faster way to manage data-table records (targets/groups/tests) by keeping the last row always in editing more
- improve UI: suite options moved under a tab and do not take space in main workspace
- improve UI: Suite panes menu (Target/Tests/...) set for sticky position (always accessible regardless of scrolling)
- improve UI: added Insert action for data table records, which injects an new empty record next to the selected one set editing mode
